[Clickwise](https://partners.clickwise.net/developers/) is an affiliate network with an API built for developers and AI agents. Search a **multi-store product catalog by GTIN**, get product links **tracked to you**, find and join affiliate programs, and pull your conversions. Use it over REST, from an AI agent through **MCP**, or from HasOffers-compatible tools.

This repo gets you from zero to a working call in under five minutes: quickstarts, thin clients, MCP configs and a deployable affiliate store.

## 1. First call, no key (60 seconds)

```sh
# How big is the catalog right now?
curl -s https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/public/catalog-stats/

# Sample products in one market (DE, ES, GB, PT, SE, FR, US); no links without a key
curl -s "https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/public/catalog-sample/?country=DE"

# Ask the MCP server which programs fit your site
curl -s https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"find_affiliate_programs","arguments":{"topic":"sneakers","country":"ES","channel":"site"}}}'
```

## 2. Get your key

Request a publisher API key at **<https://partners.clickwise.net/developers/>**. Put it in an environment variable and keep it on your server:

```sh
export CLICKWISE_API_KEY=...   # never commit it, never ship it to a browser
```

## 3. First call with your key

```sh
# Who am I, what can this key do, what are my limits?
curl -s https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/publisher/me/ -H "X-API-Key: $CLICKWISE_API_KEY"

# Fresh price, stock and YOUR tracked link for up to 100 GTINs
curl -s --get https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/publisher/products/lookup/ \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CLICKWISE_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'gtins=4006381333931,5901234123457' --data-urlencode 'country=DE'

# Search by title in one market
curl -s --get https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/publisher/products/ \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CLICKWISE_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'q=running shoes' --data-urlencode 'country=ES' --data-urlencode 'limit=20'
```

Each product comes back as `{"gtin", "title", "price", "currency", "image", "url", "merchant", "availability", ...}`. **`url` is your tracked link**: publish it exactly as returned.

Runnable versions of steps 1 and 3: [`quickstart/curl.sh`](quickstart/curl.sh) · [`quickstart/quickstart.mjs`](quickstart/quickstart.mjs) (Node 18+) · [`quickstart/quickstart.py`](quickstart/quickstart.py) (Python 3.8+). No dependencies.

## 4. Use it from an AI agent (MCP)

Remote MCP server (Streamable HTTP): **`https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/mcp`**, listed in the official MCP Registry as `net.clickwise/mcp`. 19 tools; the key is optional (program discovery, deals, catalog stats and instant tracked links work without it).

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http clickwise https://partners.clickwise.net/api/v1/mcp --header "X-API-Key: $CLICKWISE_API_KEY"
```

Configs for **Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code and n8n**, plus the tool list, in [`mcp/`](mcp/README.md).

## 5. Ship an affiliate store

[`templates/affiliate-store`](templates/affiliate-store): a Next.js storefront that reads products by GTIN, shows live prices and publishes your tracked links. It deploys without a key in preview mode.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsoftdevfz%2Fclickwise-api&root-directory=templates%2Faffiliate-store&project-name=my-affiliate-store&repository-name=my-affiliate-store)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/softdevfz/clickwise-api)

Building with **Lovable, Bolt or v0**? Paste [`templates/affiliate-store/PROMPT.md`](templates/affiliate-store/PROMPT.md).

## 6. Clients

Thin, dependency-free clients generated from the OpenAPI, one method per operation:

- **TypeScript**: [`clients/typescript/clickwise.ts`](clients/typescript) (copy one file; Node, Bun, Deno, edge).
- **Python**: [`clients/python`](clients/python) (`pip install "git+https://github.com/softdevfz/clickwise-api#subdirectory=clients/python"`).

```ts
const cw = new Clickwise(); // CLICKWISE_API_KEY
const { products } = await cw.lookupProducts({ gtins: "4006381333931", country: "DE" });
```

## What the API covers

| Area | Endpoints (`/api/v1/publisher/…`) |
|---|---|
| Products | `GET products/` search · `GET products/lookup/` by id or GTIN (1–100) |
| Programs | `GET programs/` · `GET programs/joinable/` · `POST programs/apply/` |
| Links | `GET/POST links/` · `POST links/batch/` (up to 50, each with its own status) |
| Reporting | `GET conversions/` · `GET reports/` (day, week, month, sub-ID, campaign, status) · `GET clicks/` |
| Postbacks | `GET postback/` · `POST postback/test/` · `GET postback/deliveries/` (signed HMAC webhooks) |
| Account | `GET me/`: access and rate limits for your key |

One error shape (`{"error": {"code", "message", "status", "request_id"}}`), `RateLimit-*` headers on every response, `Retry-After` on 429, `Idempotency-Key` on POST, `X-Request-Id` everywhere. Changes inside v1 are additive.

## Rules of the road

- Keep the key on your server. A key acts only for its own account and never has admin access.
- Publish product and tracking links exactly as returned, and disclose affiliate relationships (`rel="sponsored"` on links plus a visible disclosure).
- Refresh prices at least every 48 hours; hide products a lookup no longer returns.
- Honour rate limits: back off on 429 using `Retry-After`.
